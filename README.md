DjangoPBX
--------------------------------------
DjangoPBX - A full-featured domain based multi-tenant PBX driven by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [FreeSWITCH™](https://freeswitch.com).

The objective of this project is to provide a GUI wrap around FreeSWITCH™ using Django and the
Python language. To minimise the number of .lua support scripts by utilising the FreeSWITCH modules
mod_xml_curl and mod_httapi, and also provide a platform that is easy to learn and code owing to
its use of just one programming language.

DjangoPBX basically does two things:  
1. It provides a portal for end users and device configuration.
2. It generates FreeSWITCH configuration from the data you provide in the Admin interface.

## Key features
* Simple, straight forward and un-complicated.
* Use of Python leads to more robust applications through exception handling and strong types.
* Uses the proven Django Application Framework, so upgrades and database migrations are handled for you.
* Multi language, all user text is passed through the Django translation mechanism.
* Easily extended by adding new application modules.
* Full REST API provided by the Django REST Framework.

From an ITSP or end user perspective DjangoPBX provides all the facilities of a modern call handling platform.
